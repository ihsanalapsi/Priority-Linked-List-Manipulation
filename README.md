# Priority-Linked-List-Manipulation
This project focuses on working with a linked list sorted by priority values. It provides implementations in two programming languages (C++ and C) to achieve the following core functionalities:

Node Insertion: The program allows the insertion of new nodes into the linked list, along with associated data and priority values. The inserted nodes are automatically positioned based on their priority values.
Node Swapping: By inputting two priority values, the program swaps the positions of nodes having those priorities. The swap process also involves updating the priority values of the swapped nodes.
Linked List Printing: The linked list is printed in an organized manner, presenting the nodes according to their priority values.
Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to get started with using and exploring this project.

# Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (for fs.cpp) or a C compiler (for sc.cpp) is required to compile and run the code.
Basic understanding of linked lists and programming concepts is beneficial.
Usage
Compile the code using a suitable compiler.
Run the executable to execute the program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the linked list and perform node manipulation.
